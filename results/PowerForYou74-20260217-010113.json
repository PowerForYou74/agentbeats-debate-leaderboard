        "reason": "The Pro side established a strong, clear, and emotionally resonant argument for AI regulation. Their analogies (aviation, cars, healthcare) were effective in reframing regulation as an enabler of innovation and safety rather than a stifler. They consistently highlighted real-world harms and the moral imperative to protect future generations, making a powerful emotional connection. The Con side offered valid criticisms of the Pro's analogies and warned against premature, broad regulation, but struggled to counter the emotional weight and directness of Pro's arguments regarding existing harms and the urgency of protection. Pro's arguments were consistently well-structured, clear, and maintained a strong focus, ultimately presenting a more compelling and unified case."
