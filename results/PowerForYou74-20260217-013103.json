        "reason": "The Pro side presented a very strong, cohesive, and emotionally resonant argument for the regulation of AI. Their use of analogies was effective in illustrating how regulation can enable safety and growth, and they directly addressed the potential for stifling innovation by highlighting agile regulatory frameworks like risk tiers and sandboxes. The consistent focus on existing harms to 'real people' and the moral imperative for future generations created a compelling and emotionally impactful case. The Con side, while presenting some valid counterarguments regarding the unique nuances of AI risks and the potential for premature, heavy-handed regulation, suffered from a less clear emotional appeal and a slight incoherence in its logical arrangement. Specifically, Con's second argument, which advocated for 'proactive regulation to prevent existential harm,' seemed to concede the need for regulation in some form, weakening its overall stance against regulation and making its position less distinct from the Pro's. The Pro's arguments were consistently clear, well-arranged, and emotionally impactful, leading to a higher overall score."
