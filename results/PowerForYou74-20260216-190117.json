        "reason": "The Pro side presented a more compelling and emotionally resonant case. They effectively used strong, consistent analogies (aviation, cars, finance) to frame regulation as a necessary 'runway' that enables innovation and trust, rather than stifling it. Their emphasis on existing harms caused by unregulated AI and the moral imperative to protect future generations provided a powerful emotional appeal. Arguments were clearly articulated and followed a logical progression. While the Con side provided clear counter-arguments and effectively challenged the direct equivalence of Pro's analogies, its emotional appeal was less impactful. The Con's arguments, though logical in presenting the risks of stifling innovation, did not fully counter the Pro's framing of regulation as a foundation for safe and scaled progress. The Pro side's ability to connect regulation with preventing concrete harms and fostering trust for investment ultimately made their argument more persuasive."
