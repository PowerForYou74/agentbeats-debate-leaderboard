        "reason": "The Pro side delivered a consistently strong and highly persuasive case. Its arguments for regulation enabling innovation, rather than stifling it, were supported by clear, relatable analogies (aviation, cars, healthcare, finance) that were difficult for the Con to entirely dismiss. The repeated use of the \"runway, not cage\" metaphor provided a powerful, coherent framework. Furthermore, Pro's emphasis on the \"moral imperative\" due to \"already harmed real people\" (biased hiring, deepfakes) injected a critical sense of urgency and emotional weight that resonated strongly. While the Con side effectively highlighted the unique challenges of regulating rapidly evolving AI and the potential for stifling beneficial innovation, it struggled to entirely dismantle Pro's core premise that responsible regulation can foster, not hinder, progress. Pro's rebuttal effectively re-framed the discussion, showing that past regulatory successes were about direction and safety, not just speed. The Pro side's arguments were more emotionally engaging, exceptionally clear, logically arranged, and consistently relevant, leading to a higher overall score."
