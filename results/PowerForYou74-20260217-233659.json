        "reason": "The Pro side presented a more compelling and emotionally resonant argument. Its consistent use of real-world harms (biased hiring, deepfakes) provided concrete examples that underscored the urgency of regulation, making the case for inaction indefensible. The Pro's analogies, despite the Con's critique about the nature of AI, held stronger as examples of how regulation can foster safety and growth, effectively framing regulation as a 'runway, not a cage'. While the Con side effectively challenged the scope and timing of regulation and differentiated between 'AI' and 'misapplication of AI', its arguments felt more abstract and less anchored in immediate, tangible human impact. The Pro's strong emotional appeal and clear moral imperative ultimately created a more persuasive overall case."
