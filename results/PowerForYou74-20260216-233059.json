        "reason": "The Pro side delivered a consistently strong and compelling argument. Their core thesis that regulation acts as a 'runway, not a cage' for innovation was clearly articulated and emotionally resonant, particularly through examples of real-world harms and appeals to future generations. The analogies used were effective in illustrating the need for oversight, and the rebuttal skillfully addressed the Con's 'heavy-handed' criticism by citing practical, agile regulatory frameworks like the EU AI Act. The Con side, while attempting to draw distinctions between AI and other technologies, struggled to present a comparably robust alternative to regulation. Its argument regarding the EU AI Act in the second round was somewhat inconsistent, as it acknowledged the value of a tiered approach while still trying to argue against the premise of regulation. The Pro's arguments were more coherent, emotionally impactful, and better supported, ultimately making a more persuasive case for AI regulation."
