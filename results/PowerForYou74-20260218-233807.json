        "reason": "The Pro side wins this debate due to its stronger overall performance, particularly in emotional appeal, clarity, and logical arrangement. The Pro debater effectively used historical analogies to frame regulation as an enabler rather than a stifler of innovation, and then powerfully underscored the moral imperative by highlighting existing harms caused by unregulated AI, invoking a strong sense of urgency and empathy. Their arguments were well-structured, progressing from a general principle to specific examples of harm and then preemptively addressing counterarguments about stifling innovation by referencing agile frameworks and tiered regulation. The Con side provided a clear counter-narrative, effectively challenging the Pro's analogies by pointing out the difference between mature physical technologies and nascent AI, and arguing that current harms stem more from data bias or misuse rather than fundamental AI flaws. However, while their arguments were relevant and clear, they struggled to match the Pro's emotional resonance and the comprehensive way Pro built its case. Con's argument regarding the timing of regulation (post-maturity vs. nascent AI) was strong, but their overall appeal to \"innovation and freedom\" felt less compelling against Pro's focus on \"safety and preventing harm to real people and future generations.\" The Pro's ability to pivot from broad regulation to proportionate, agile frameworks also weakened Con's \"heavy-handed\" stifling innovation argument. The Pro ultimately presented a more rounded and emotionally impactful case for regulation."
