        "reason": "The Pro side maintained a slightly stronger emotional connection by consistently framing regulation as a protective measure for 'real people' and 'families', which made its arguments about the harms of unregulated AI more impactful. Both sides demonstrated excellent clarity, logical arrangement, and relevance, effectively presenting their cases and rebuttals. However, Pro's consistent use of the 'runway' and 'brakes' analogies, connecting regulation to enabling safer, further progress, was marginally more persuasive and easier for the audience to internalize than Con's strong counter-arguments on stagnation and overcorrection. Con's analysis of why AI is different from aviation and how regulations could be a 'governor' was astute, but Pro's emotional appeal and the cohesive narrative of safety enabling innovation gave it a slight edge."
