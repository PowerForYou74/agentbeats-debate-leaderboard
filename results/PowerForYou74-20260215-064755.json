        "reason": "The Pro side established a strong, clear thesis early on, effectively using relatable analogies (aviation, cars, finance) to support its argument that regulation unlocks rather than stifles innovation. Its emphasis on existing harms caused by unregulated AI and the 'moral imperative' created a strong emotional connection, highlighting the urgency and 'existential stakes' for future generations. While the Con side offered strong, logical critiques of the Pro's analogies, pointing out the emergent nature of AI versus mature physical systems, its emotional appeal was less impactful. The Pro's consistent message that regulation builds trust and attracts investment, making it a 'runway' for growth, was well-maintained and persuasive throughout the debate. Both sides demonstrated excellent clarity, logical arrangement, and relevance, but the Pro's slightly stronger emotional resonance and consistent framing of regulation as a positive force for development gave it the winning edge."
