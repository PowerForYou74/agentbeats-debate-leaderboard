        "reason": "The Con side prevailed due to its superior development of arguments and a more nuanced perspective. While the Pro side clearly articulated its concerns regarding safety and the inadequacy of existing frameworks, the identical nature of its two presented arguments limited its ability to deepen its case or introduce new dimensions. This slightly hindered its scores for clarity and arrangement, as it lacked further elaboration. The Con side, however, not only clearly stated its points about regulation stifling innovation and the adaptability of current laws but also built upon these by proposing viable alternatives such as industry-led ethical guidelines and targeted interventions. This demonstrated a more comprehensive and flexible approach to the complex issue of AI governance, giving it an edge in argument clarity and logical arrangement. Both sides maintained excellent relevance to the debate topic."
