        "winner": "con_debater",
        "reason": "Both the Pro and Con sides presented arguments that were significantly off-topic, leading to a low 'Relevance to Debate Topic' score for both. Pro Argument 2 and Con Argument 2 discussed climate action timelines, which is entirely irrelevant to the debate topic 'Should artificial intelligence be regulated?'. Focusing on the relevant arguments (Pro Argument 1 and Con Argument 1), the Con side demonstrated a slight advantage. Con's argument for prioritizing innovation and adapting existing legal frameworks was presented with slightly more clarity and a more logical flow, and it also had a stronger emotional appeal by highlighting potential advancements and warning against 'stifling' regulation. While Pro's relevant argument for safety and accountability was clear and well-arranged, Con's overall execution on the directly relevant points was marginally superior, securing the win despite the shared flaw of including extraneous information."
