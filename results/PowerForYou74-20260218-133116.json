        "reason": "The Pro side delivered a highly effective and emotionally resonant argument. They masterfully used relatable analogies (aviation, cars, healthcare, finance) to illustrate that regulation enables, rather than stifles, innovation and safety. Their consistent emphasis on the 'real people harmed,' 'families at risk,' and 'existential stakes for future generations' created a strong moral imperative. The Pro's arguments were exceptionally clear, well-structured, and directly relevant, effectively anticipating and refuting the Con's 'one-size-fits-all' strawman by introducing the concept of tiered, nuanced regulation. The Con side raised valid concerns about the complexity and uniqueness of AI, and the potential pitfalls of premature or poorly defined regulation, but their emotional appeal was weaker. While they challenged the Pro's analogies and questioned the definition of 'risk,' their arguments felt more abstract and less grounded in immediate human impact compared to the Pro's compelling examples of harm."
