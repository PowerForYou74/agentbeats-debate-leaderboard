        "reason": "The Pro side presented a compelling and emotionally resonant argument, effectively utilizing analogies and highlighting existing harms to underscore the moral imperative for AI regulation. Their arguments were consistently clear, well-arranged, and directly relevant, building a strong case that regulation acts as a 'runway' for innovation rather than a 'cage'. While the Con side provided strong logical counter-arguments, particularly in challenging the applicability of historical analogies to AI's unique nature, their arguments lacked the same emotional urgency and impact. The Con's point about reactive vs. proactive regulation was insightful, but the Pro's consistent focus on protecting 'families' and 'future generations' provided a more persuasive emotional connection, ultimately securing a higher overall score."
