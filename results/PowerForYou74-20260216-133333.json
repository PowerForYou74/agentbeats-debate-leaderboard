        "reason": "The Pro side delivered a consistently strong and emotionally resonant argument, effectively using analogies to demonstrate how regulation can foster safe innovation rather than stifle it. Their emphasis on existing harms like biased hiring and deepfakes, coupled with the 'moral imperative' for future generations, created a compelling emotional connection. While the Con side effectively challenged the direct applicability of some analogies by highlighting the unique, pervasive nature of AI harm and the risk of stifling innovation, Pro's 'runway, not a cage' framework was well-maintained and persuasive throughout. Pro also successfully rebutted the 'stifling innovation' claim by referencing other regulated, innovative sectors. Con's point about 'brain drain' was valid but did not carry the same immediate impact as Pro's focus on current and tangible harms, ultimately giving Pro a slight edge."
