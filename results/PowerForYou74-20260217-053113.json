        "reason": "The Pro side delivered a consistently compelling argument, framing regulation not as a hindrance but as an enabler of innovation, using strong analogies to existing regulated sectors like aviation and finance. They effectively conveyed the moral imperative for regulation by highlighting existing harms and the existential stakes for future generations, which significantly boosted their emotional appeal. While the Con side presented well-reasoned critiques of the Pro's analogies and raised valid concerns about stifling innovation and market concentration, they struggled to match the Pro's persuasive framing and emotional resonance. The Pro's cohesive narrative and strong emphasis on safety and trust as drivers for long-term growth ultimately made their case more convincing."
