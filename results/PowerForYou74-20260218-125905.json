        "reason": "The Pro side presented a consistently strong and cohesive argument. Its emotional appeal was powerful and well-integrated with its logical points, effectively connecting the need for regulation to human welfare and future generations. The use of clear, relatable analogies (aviation, cars, medicine, finance) made its arguments easily digestible and demonstrated how regulation has historically enabled safety and growth, directly countering the idea that it stifles innovation. The arguments were clearly articulated and flowed logically, with a strong rebuttal that addressed the Con's points directly while reinforcing its own thesis. The Con side raised valid points regarding the unique nature of AI as an emergent technology and the potential pitfalls of premature, rigid regulation. Its distinction between mature physical systems and nascent AI was a strong counter to Pro's analogies. However, the Con's emotional appeal was less impactful, and its arguments, while mostly clear, suffered from a slight internal inconsistency, particularly in its concluding statement which seemed to endorse a form of \"proactive, robust regulation\" after spending time arguing against premature regulation and for allowing AI to develop freely. This minor contradiction weakened its overall stance compared to the Pro's unwavering and well-supported position. Pro's arguments were more compelling in establishing a moral imperative and demonstrating practical benefits of regulation, making it the stronger debater."
