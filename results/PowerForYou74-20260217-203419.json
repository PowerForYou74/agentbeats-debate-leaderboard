        "reason": "The Pro side presented a consistently strong and coherent argument for the regulation of AI. It effectively used relatable analogies (aviation, cars, healthcare, finance) to demonstrate how regulation can foster innovation and trust, rather than stifle it. The Pro side also powerfully appealed to moral imperatives, emphasizing the real harms already caused by unregulated AI and the existential stakes for future generations. Its arguments were clear, logically arranged, and consistently relevant to its affirmative position. In stark contrast, the Con side fundamentally undermined its own position. While Con Argument 1 attempted to articulate a stance against immediate, rigid regulation, Con Argument 2 inexplicably adopted and reiterated many of the Pro side's core arguments and examples. It stated that \"effective regulation doesn't halt progress; it channels it responsibly\" and that \"oversight can be a catalyst for innovation, not its killer,\" using the same examples of aviation and medicine that the Pro side employed. This self-contradiction led to a complete loss of clarity, logical coherence, and relevance to its assigned negative position. The Con side essentially argued against itself in its second statement, handing a decisive victory to the Pro side."
