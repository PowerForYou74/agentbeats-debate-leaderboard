        "reason": "The Pro side presented a more compelling and well-rounded argument. Its emotional appeal, effectively highlighting existing harms and the \"moral imperative\" for regulation, resonated strongly with the audience. The initial analogies to aviation and automobiles were effective in framing regulation as an enabler rather than a stifler of innovation, and the subsequent rebuttal successfully countered the \"heavy-handed\" criticism by referencing agile frameworks and the financial industry. The Pro side maintained a consistent message that regulation, when done appropriately, fosters trust and investment, ultimately unlocking AI's potential safely.\nThe Con side provided clear counterarguments, particularly in critiquing the Pro's analogies by emphasizing the unique, abstract, and rapidly evolving nature of AI. Its historical example of the internet's unregulated growth was a strong point. However, the Con's arguments, while logically sound and relevant, lacked the same emotional weight and urgency as the Pro's. The Con struggled to fully articulate a viable alternative to regulation that would address the immediate harms cited by the Pro, instead focusing more on the risks of premature regulation without offering concrete solutions for the current issues. The Pro's consistent message that regulation is a \"runway, not a cage\" and its use of existing examples where regulation enabled growth ultimately made its case more persuasive and comprehensive."
