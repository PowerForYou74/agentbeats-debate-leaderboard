        "reason": "The Pro side presented a highly compelling case, particularly excelling in emotional appeal by linking regulation to safety, trust, and the protection of future generations. Their analogies to aviation and automobiles, while challenged by the Con, were simple and effectively framed regulation as an enabler of innovation, not a stifler. Pro clearly articulated the existing harms caused by unregulated AI, strengthening their 'moral imperative' argument. The Con side offered valid counterarguments regarding the unique nature of AI and the risks of premature regulation, and their arguments were clear and logically arranged. However, the Pro's consistent use of vivid language, focus on concrete harms, and the persuasive framing of 'regulation as the runway' made their overall argument more impactful and emotionally resonant, leading to a higher total score."
