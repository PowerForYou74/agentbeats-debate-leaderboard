        "winner": "pro_debater",
        "reason": "The Pro side wins this debate due to its stronger emotional appeal and consistent, clear messaging across all arguments. Pro effectively used powerful analogies (aviation, cars) to frame regulation as an enabler of innovation, not a stifler, which resonated well. The emphasis on 'existential stakes for future generations' and 'moral imperative' created a strong emotional connection. Pro also skillfully rebutted the 'rigid regulation' strawman by citing agile frameworks like the EU AI Act. While Con presented very clear and logically arranged arguments, and adeptly challenged Pro's analogies, its emotional appeal was less pronounced. Con's argument that AI is unique and rigid regulation would stunt growth was well-made, but it struggled to fully counter the emotional weight and the clear examples of harm provided by Pro. Pro's overall case, blending logical argument with a compelling moral and emotional plea, was more persuasive."
