        "reason": "The Pro side presented a very strong and cohesive argument. They effectively used historical analogies, cited real-world harms from unregulated AI, and consistently maintained a clear, logical, and emotionally resonant position that regulation unlocks innovation and ensures safety. Every point was relevant and clearly articulated. The Con side's performance was severely hampered by a critical internal contradiction. While Con Argument 1 articulated objections to regulation, Con Argument 2 completely reversed course, essentially arguing *for* regulation using the Pro's examples and even adopting pro-regulation language. This fundamental inconsistency destroyed the Con's clarity, logical arrangement, and overall credibility, making their argument incoherent and self-defeating. As a result, the Pro side is the clear winner."
